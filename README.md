# LogicGates

An android app that teaches it's user about the seven basic logic gates found in electronics. Logic gates are the basic building block of a digital circuit. Logic gates are the physical devices inside electronics that carry out a Boolean function, which outputs something if something else is true. There are six basic logic gates and most of each has two inputs and one output. Two inputs can be either 0 (false/low) or 1 (true/high).

In this app you will be able to do the following:
-learn about different gates 
-see their truth table 
-interact with live logic gates 
-take quiz to see how much you know about each logic gates
-you can learn fast
